## Bayesian Optimization â€“ Summary

- **Bayesian Optimization** is a **sequential strategy** for global optimization of **black-box functions** that are **costly to evaluate**.
- It aims to find the **maximum or minimum** of an unknown function `f(x)`, where `x` represents hyperparameters.
  - Mathematically, we want to find the global maximizer (or minimizer) of an unknown (black box) objective function $$f$$:
    $$\[
    \mathbf{x}^* = \arg\max_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}} f(\mathbf{x})
    \]$$
    where x are the hyperparameters
    
### Bayesian Optimization works well
- $$f$$ we want to maximise/minimise is continuous.
- $$f$$ is difficult to evaluate -> too much time or money
- $$f$$ lacks known structure, like concavity or linearity -> $$f$$ is black box
- $$f$$ has nbo derivative -> we can't evaluate a gradient
- $$f$$ can be evaluarted at arbitrary points of x (the hyperparameters)
   - we can make point wise observations of $$f$$ (Observing the value of the objective function at specific input points, one at a time) 

### Key Concepts in Bayesian Optimization
- Treats the unknown function `f` as a **random function**.
- Places a **prior** over `f`, representing our belief about its behavior before seeing data.
  - The prior is a function that captures the belief distribution behaviour of $$f$$
- Evaluates `f` at selected points (i.e., runs models with specific hyperparameters).
- with the new data, updates the prior using the observed data to form a **posterior** distribution.
- The posterior distribution is used  to construct an acquisition function to determine the next query point.
-  - Uses an **acquisition function** to decide **where to evaluate next** in the hyperparameter space.

### Models for estimating the Prior
- For the purpose of bayesian optimisation, we need  to find a function that will act as prior of $$f$$
- This function can be estimated one of the below:
  - **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**
  - **Tree-Parzen Estimators (TPE)**
  - **Random Forests**

### Acquisition Functions
- once we derive a posterior function, we need an acquisition function to determine where to sample next
- This can be estimated using one of the below:
  - **Expected Improvement (EI)**
  - **Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB)**
  - Other available strategies
